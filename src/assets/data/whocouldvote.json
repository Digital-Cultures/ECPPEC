So-called ‘rotten boroughs’ had the right to return two MPs to Westminster even if they had only a tiny number of inhabitants. Typically they had once been important places, but for one reason or another they had been largely depopulated by the eighteenth century. The most famous examples are Dunwich, much of which had fallen into the sea, and Old Sarum, from which the population had moved away to Salisbury. Mitchell had always been small, but by 1831 it had been reduced to just 7 voters. With tiny electorates, rotten boroughs could easily be dominated by the local landowners who effectively owned the borough and its parliamentary representation.",

        "question": "now you know if you would have been able to vote in an eighteenth-century parliamentary election or not. Whether you have the vote depends on who you are, where you are, and in some cases, on your economic standing. You could actually vote in more than one constituency in the same election (‘plural voting’), if for example you were resident in one place and owned property in another, or were a member of a university senate. But bear in mind that if you put yourself forward to vote, you might be challenged. The agents of those candidates who you’re not supporting could seek to prevent you from voting, or to have your poll disqualified after you’d cast it, arguing that you don’t meet the criteria. Perhaps you don’t hold the right kind of property, or you haven’t lived in the constituency long enough. Can you prove that you are qualified to vote?",

In most cases the House voted to narrow electorates, either by replacing a franchise wholesale to a more restrictive category, or by introducing new residency or financial qualifications. However, by the later eighteenth century, as public concern grew over constituencies with particularly small electorates, a handful of franchises were significantly widened to incorporate the freeholders of surrounding hundreds: New Shoreham (1771), Cricklade (1782), and Aylesbury (1804).",
